### **5. Handle Dependencies**
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Use as few external libraries as possible to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Specify Versions**: If your library relies on external dependencies, include their versions in the `.podspec`.

---

### **6. Optimize and Test Build Settings**
- Ensure the library builds for all targeted platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, etc.).
- Verify that the deployment target is set appropriately (e.g., `s.ios.deployment_target = '12.0'` in the `.podspec`).
- Test the library with both **Debug** and **Release** configurations.

---

### **7. Ensure Compatibility**
- **Swift Version**: Specify compatible Swift versions in the `.podspec` (`s.swift_versions`).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: If the library is meant to be cross-platform (iOS, macOS, etc.), ensure it builds and works correctly on all platforms.

### **8. Add Licensing**
Include a `LICENSE` file in your repository. Choose an appropriate license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) to define how others can use your code.
